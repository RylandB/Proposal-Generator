## **Summary**

This proposal generation tool is a marketing tool for Accutech Systems' client banks. Users can upload a pdf or image of a brokerage statement from a competitor. The tool will work with Accutech Cheetah to generate a side-by-side comparison of the prospective investor's current investment strategy versus how it would be managed with Accutech's investment strategy.
