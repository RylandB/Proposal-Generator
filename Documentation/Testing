## Testing Requirements
Most functionality of Puma is reliant on having valid Cheetah login credentials. As such, testing is only possible in a limited capacity.
Certain tests can be run by downloading the source code and opening it in a C# IDE. Our development environment uses Jetbrains Rider.

## Flurl Testing
After opening the project, the CS495-Capstone-Puma.UnitTests Project contains all tests. Those tests can be run through the Rider IDE.
This will test for proper Flurl usage and syntax.

## Javascript Testing


## API Communication Testing
These tests can only be performed by someone with valid Cheetah Credentials. Without these credentials, the system will error.
